clothes_prompt = """
Clothes: Expedition-ready scientific gear inspired by Annihilation: 
fitted olive-drab field jackets and cargo pants with reinforced knee pads, 
moisture-wicking long-sleeve technical shirts, heavy-duty tactical boots and 
utility belts loaded with sample vials. Subtle wear-and-tear and faded unit 
patches accent a lived-in look. Add phosphorescent veins weaving along seams, 
faint bioluminescent patterns pulsing like a heartbeat beneath the fabric, 
and mirrored lenses reflecting cryptic glows—casting shifting shadows that 
hint at something just out of sight.
"""

background_prompt = """
Background: Surreal, Shimmer-infused wilderness: a dense, overgrown forest 
of mutated, iridescent flora. Bioluminescent fungi clusters and 
color-shifting pools emit an eerie, prismatic light. Shafts of ghostly green 
and violet pierce through twisted branches, illuminating swirling mist that 
shimmers like whispered secrets. Floating spores glow with alien intensity, 
and distant, abstract animal silhouettes flicker in the shadows—an atmosphere 
thick with arcane mystery and hidden transformation.
